# CVID
A Single-Cell Atlas of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)


This is a repository with key analyses from the ["Single-Cell Atlas of Common Variable Immunodeficiency"](https://www.cvidcellatlas.org/).

Repo organisation:

- **scMethylation** folder: code relevant for the analysis of single cell whole genome bisulfite sequencing data for Naive, US-mem and S-mem B cells

- **scChromAccess** folder: code relevant for the analysis of single cell ATAC-sequencing data for Naive, US-mem and S-mem B cells

- **scTranscriptomics** folder: code relevant for the analysis of single cell transcriptomics data for Naive, US-mem and S-mem B cells (steady state, Smart-seq2 platform) and single cell transcriptomics data for activated PBMCs (10X platform)


General lingo: 
- ```M``` in the beginning of a notebook name is for **M**ain analysis, ```S``` - for **S**ubanalysis, numbers indicate the order of analyses
- SS2 is for Smart-seq2
